            "text": "CSE 291 is a graduate course on language-based security. Most software we rely\nupon is plagued by security vulnerabilities \u2014 the common occurrence of\nlarge-scale private data theft alone serves to highlight the magnitude of the\nproblem. Yet the rise of new application domains and platforms (e.g., crypto\ncurrencies and IoT) is making software ever more integral to daily life. It is\nprudent for us to build more secure software systems.\n\n\nOne promising approach to building secure systems is to leverage ideas from\nprogramming languages and program analysis. The recent industry trend of\nadopting new languages, type systems, and tools \u2014 as exemplified by Mozilla's\n\nRust\n and Facebook's \nInfer\n \u2014\nalso makes this approach very timely.\n\n\nThis course explores the use of various programming languages and program\nanalysis methods to (1) enforce security, and (2) to rigorously specify and\nreason about security.  We will study secure runtime systems (e.g., operating\nsystems, web servers, hardware architectures) and the underlying techniques\nused to make them secure (e.g., language-level information flow control,\ncapabilities, static checkers, symbolic execution, linear type systems).\n\n\nThis is a research-oriented class: students are expected to read papers in\ndepth and work on a relatively large research project that can ideally lead to\na conference publication.\n\n\nCourse prerequisites\nStudents should have knowledge of programming languages (e.g., CSE 130),\noperating systems (e.g., CSE 120), and security (e.g., CSE 127).  We will\nbe reading research papers on advanced topics with very brief\nintroductions, so students should be familiar with topics in these areas\n(e.g., language semantics, virtual memory management, basic web security)\nor be willing to independently pick up these topics.\nMeeting time and locating\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nLocation:\n CSE 2154\n\n\nTime:\n Mondays and Wednesdays 3:30-4:50PM",
